### Reflections

**Problem** 

Trade NFTs in Discord requires to be pending about a reply also if a NFT is popular I could get lost with tons of messages, is not really convenient, also I need to trust the other user (buyer) to send me the SOL I want

**Solution**

A platform can be built to post NFTs and let users to bet on it so I can set the min SOL I want in order to sell my NFT, this proccess is automatized
